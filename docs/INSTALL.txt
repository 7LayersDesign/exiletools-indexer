To get this up and running:

1. Install, configure and start Elasticsearch
2. Edit the tools/setup/es-recreate* files with a proper index name, then run them
3. Touch .dbcreds in root directory (it does not need anything in it, current legacy)
4. Edit the config file in the root directory and set a proper basedir and index names that match step 2
5. mkdir -p the basedir and basedir/logs
6. Edit poe-watch-stash-tab-river and make sure the JSONLOG section is commented out if you don't want this
7. Install perl, cpanminus, and all required perl modules (see below)
   # cpanm LWP::UserAgent JSON JSON::XS Encode utf8::all Date::Parse Time::HiRes Search::Elasticsearch Text::Unidecode Data::Dumper 
8. put "elasticsearch" as an alias in /etc/hosts for your localhost
9. Remove the two extra eshost lines from poe-watch-stash-tab-river if they're in there (and the , on the line above)
10. run ./poe-watch-stash-tab-river and away it goes!

You can use the example supervisord configuration file to set this to be run automatically.

The first few runs may be slow as Elasticsearch builds the proper mappings, but everything should speed up before too long.

You can also copy everything in www/html to your nginx or apache root directory and get access to the dashboard/etc. stuff,
though you will need to change the URL's in them to your local install of elasticsearch for everything to work.

* Notes on installing stuff on centos 6 for my own machines:

** Supervisord

1. install pip and pip install supervisor, then uninstall meld3 and install via yum
