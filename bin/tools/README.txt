This directory contains various tools for use with the ExileTools
Indexer. They are not all supported or well documented, and will
not always be updated (some of them will not work on the latest
version due to architecture changes).

Mostly these are for personal use / troubleshooting by Pete, but
included in the project for testing.

The "setup" directory contains some very simple scripts that can
be used to set up the ElasticSearch indexes as well as Supervisor
templates.
