<title>Real Time Stash IO API</title>

<h1>This API requires a WebSocket based connection using something like Socket-IO for filtering.</h1>

<p>You will need to find a client to use this or write your own code. This page itself does not serve anything
to allow you to connect.</p>

<p>Try <a href="http://api.exiletools.com/info/rsstashio.html">the official docs</a>.</p>
